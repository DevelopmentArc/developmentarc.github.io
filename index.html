        <p>
          DevelopmentArc<sup>&reg;</sup> was founded in 2008 to provide software development, management and technology services for a wide range of companies. Our goal is to help you and your team define goals, provide a process to implement them and then guarantee that you retain ownership of your technology investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we have worked with a wide range of companies: from Fortune 500 organizations to stealth-mode start-ups. Every company and team has their own needs and challenges and at DevelopmentArc<sup>&reg;</sup> we take the time to understand this and apply our experience to achieve your vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do this by taking the time analyze and understand your current position before making any recommendations. Under planning can be just as dangerous as over-planning and we strive to find the perfect balance for everyone involved. Once we have a solid grasp of your needs we make recommendations on how to approach the solution. This involves technology recommendations, architectural oversight, development &amp; cost estimations, team additions (if required), technology implementation and infrastructure &amp; system investments to achieve your end goals.
